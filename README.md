Description:

Every college student knows the struggle of looking at the syllabus and seeing the recommended books for each subject, only to be shocked at the cost of buying these books in hard copies. Then after paying the price, they take weeks to arrive. After using them for a semester, what can we do with them?
We have a solution for you: Student Mart! S Mart is a marketplace for all your student needs, right in our IIITK campus.

Once you open the Smart app, you can register with your details , including your branch and semester, and hostel in college. 
When you log in, you can browse the categories for what you are looking for, or search here.
Find what you’re looking for? Open it up to find it’s price and details. You can see the user’s hostel to help you find an ad closest to you. If you can’t afford the price listed, look out for ads with the tag “willing to give for free to needy students”. You can call the user through the app to finalise the purchase. 
If you want to sell something, you can go to Sell, pick your category of item, and fill in the details. 
We have seven categories of things to buy and sell from: Books, Electronics,  Vehicles, Music Instruments, Sports Equipment, Snacks, and Miscellaneous. 

Given time, we would like to add:
-Search filters, 
-Ad recommendations on the home page using ML to help buyers find what they want easily, a public wall where students can post requests for items they can’t find. 
-And of course, expand our app by adding other college communities to S Mart.

We would love to see students use S Mart to make their lives easier, and make a buck while helping others save a buck!
